# Scikit-rf_practice
This is file is a scikit-rf python practice file I made by following a video and a documentation website.
If you go to this site -> https://scikit-rf.org/index.html#
On the media and line part the code that is being used is a little outdated.
For that part I find that -> from skrf.media.freespace import Freespace work
                             fs = Freespace(<code>)
